# Camagru
First solo web project for the web based semester at WeThinkCode_ using PHP, HTML and CSS.

Needs to be a web application that is similar to instagram. Users can create accounts to post images on the site and get likes and comments on their images from other authenticated users. Users can edit account preferences and should confirm their account creation through a  unique link received via email. Pictures can be taken and directly uploaded from the webcam, or uploaded from the pc. taken/uplaoded images can also be combined with one of a list of supplied images from the website and then uploaded. login details are validated against a database and secure encryptions are used to store data.
